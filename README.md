# PRODIGY_ML_01
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

# Description

The model is a Linear Regression model trained with the House Prices Dataset. The model uses *Area, No. Of Bedrooms, and, No. of Bathrooms* as main features to predict the *Sale Price* of the given house. The model additionaly utilizes 3 more parameters, generated with PCA. The model exhibited an R2 score of ***0.584***.

# Dataset

The model is trained on **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** Dataset provided in Kaggle.
